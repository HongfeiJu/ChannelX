		<p align= "center"> With the availability of e-mail, SMS, Slack, and many other messaging applications, many channels exist for connecting two or more people. However, existing channels permanently associate an identifier with a user, making the user always reachable at the same handle. However, many of our activities require communication channels that are more transient in nature. Many times, we do not really want to give an otherwise perfect stranger our phone number, but we do want that person to be able to contact us, potentially for a limited time or in limited circumstances. For instance, a university teaching assistant may want to make a channel available to students in a course only during designated "available" hours and only for the duration of a semester. A seller (or buyer) on a service like Craigslist may want to create a channel of availability for the duration of a given transaction. By making these transient channels available, a user can protect his or her identity and the more direct channels (e.g., not having to give a phone number out to a potential buyer on Craigslist). The goal of this project is to create a service that supports the creation of such transient channels with user-friendly names, associates them with (hidden) permanent handles for the users, and manages the lifecycle of the created channels.</p>
